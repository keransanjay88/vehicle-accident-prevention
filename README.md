# VEHICLE ACCIDENT PREVENTION USING IOT

`IOT , ARDUINO`

The vehicle accident prevention system uses IR sensors to detect obstacles in front and back. When obstacles are detected, it activates warning signals with LEDs and a buzzer to alert the driver, helping to prevent collisions. Additionally, the system continuously monitors the surroundings during the vehicle's operation and provides real-time feedback to ensure timely responses from the driver. The integration of IR sensors offers a cost-effective and reliable solution for enhancing road safety.
